    <h1>My Strengths and Weaknesses</h1>

    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <p><strong>Respect</strong> is my first and foremost strength. It holds a central place in my life because it’s a value that was instilled in me from a young age and that I consider a foundation in both personal and professional relationships. I always pay attention to the way I speak, especially in tense situations.</p>

    <p>I also see myself as someone with <strong>flexible thinking</strong>. When a problem arises, I take the time to listen to other people’s suggestions, even if they contradict my initial idea. I try to remain objective and avoid forcing my way of doing things. I use this strength often during group projects, as it helps reduce tension and makes other team members feel involved.</p>

    <p>Another strength of mine is <strong>perseverance</strong>. For example, when I’m faced with a challenge, especially when it comes to developing or analyzing a program, I never give up. I’ve often spent several hours, even days, trying to find a logical error in an analysis or a bug in a program. Even though it’s time-consuming and tiring, solving these problems on my own gives me a great sense of satisfaction.</p>

    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
    <p>Of course, like everyone else, I also have some weaknesses that I try to recognize and improve day by day.</p>

    <p>The first one may seem contradictory to my flexible thinking: I need a certain amount of <strong>structure</strong>. I’m very detail-oriented, and small things can bother me, like poorly aligned code, misplaced brackets, or a script with no comments at all. It’s not a real obstacle, since I know how to manage this frustration, but I tend to believe that even in a flexible environment, it’s essential to have a solid foundation, especially in computing, where every line of code can lead to new problems. For me, flexibility should not be confused with disorder.</p>

    <p>Next, I’m a <strong>perfectionist</strong>. This can be a strength in many situations, as it pushes me to go all the way with my work. But it can also make me waste time on minor details or rework something that others already find good enough.</p>

    <p>Lastly, I tend to <strong>overthink</strong> things sometimes a bit too much. I often anticipate too far ahead or try to plan everything to avoid surprises. This can slow down some of my decisions. Still, I also see it as a form of caution, because once again, in computer science, a single overlooked detail can lead to major issues that take much longer to fix later if not properly thought through.</p>
