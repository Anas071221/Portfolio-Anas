    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Anas Balhor</strong>, I am 21 years old and have spent 11 years living in Brussels. I completed both my kindergarten and primary education at “Les Marronniers” school in Anderlecht. I was always a cheerful and playful child, highly motivated and hardworking. I consistently achieved top marks in every subject, often scoring 100 out of 100 until the end of my fourth grade. I was also a bit of a sore loser—when I got a nine instead of a ten, I would sometimes cry. Looking back, this reaction reflected more of my desire always to do my best than a flaw.</p>

    <p>After obtaining my CEB diploma, I moved to Gosselies (Charleroi), where I pursued my secondary education at the Athénée Royal Les Marlaires. During the early years of secondary school, I had already developed strong academic foundations, which led me to rely too heavily on my prior knowledge. However, as I reached the fourth year, the educational level increased, and I quickly understood the need to adapt and push myself further. I had to work harder and become more disciplined. From that point onward, I completed the rest of my secondary education without ever failing or needing to retake an exam. I successfully earned my CESS diploma.</p>

    <p>Today, I am enrolled in a demanding yet exciting academic program. Industrial computing allows me to explore several fields that I genuinely enjoy: algorithmic logic, programming, interface development, and everything related to network infrastructure, cybersecurity, Docker, and configuring equipment like Cisco routers.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of my studies, all these areas were completely new to me, but as I learned more, I gradually developed a genuine interest in putting them into practice.</p>

    <p>In the short term, I aim to earn my university college degree so that I can join the professional world as a web developer or full-stack developer. At the same time, I plan to take evening classes to begin a Master’s degree, specialize in a specific field, and deepen my knowledge.</p>

    <p>I'm also drawn to the idea of sharing what I learn. I would love to teach, help others, and pass on my skills and maybe one day, become a university professor.</p>

    <p>I’m extremely grateful for the support of my family. My parents and my older brother, two years ahead of me, are a constant source of encouragement. They believe in me and push me to keep going, even when things get tough. Thanks to them, I continue to move forward with determination and focus.</p>

    <p>Outside of school, sports play an essential role in my life. I’m passionate about football, but not only that. Sports are a great way to stay in good physical shape and maintain mental balance. They help me manage stress, stay focused, and channel my energy. Most of all, they remind me that hard work always pays.</p>
