    <h1>My Technical Skills</h1>

    <p>Over the past three years, I’ve acquired a strong foundation in several programming languages and technical environments, both through my coursework and my personal practice.</p>

    <p>I have a solid command of the C programming language, which I developed during my first-year classes and hands-on exercises I completed at home. I’ve gained a good understanding of key concepts such as pointers, arrays, and the use of standard functions like scanf, printf, getch, and getchar. I also learned how to read from and write to both text and binary files.</p>

    <p>Later on, I gradually built my skills in Java, a language I discovered in my second year. I worked on several key concepts, including ArrayLists, circular lists, finite state systems, and thread management. Java was also my first experience with object-oriented programming, which gave me a new perspective on software structure and design.</p>

    <p>When it comes to embedded systems, I have a good level of experience using C++ with hardware platforms such as the Arduino Uno and the ESP8266. With these devices, I’ve completed multiple school projects involving temperature, light, and motion detection using various sensors. I was able to control different types of motors, like servo motors and stepper motors, and even display some data on an I2C LCD screen.</p>

    <p>For example, in my second-year project, I used an Arduino Uno to handle the electronics part. Then, in my third-year project, I used the ESP8266 to process data and send it in real time to a mobile application while also handling sensor readings and actuators.</p>

    <p>I’ve also acquired a solid foundation in full-stack development in terms of web and mobile development. In my second-year project, for instance, I used JavaScript and the Express.js framework to create the API for my web application. I also used Twig to build dynamic pages. Later, during a project at Technocampus, I worked with TypeScript and React to design web pages, define routes, and display real-time data.</p>

    <p>On the networking and system administration side, I’ve developed valuable skills in a Red Hat Linux environment, working on virtual machines. I learned how to configure an Apache web server, deploy DHCP and DNS services, use SSH with techniques like port forwarding, and set up a VPN tunnel using OpenVPN. These skills are extremely relevant, as many companies rely on Red Hat systems for their infrastructure.</p>

    <p>In the industrial automation field, I’ve worked with Siemens (PLC 1512) and Schneider PLCs. I can program GRAFCET logic and regulate a system’s temperature using a PID controller. During a project at Technocampus, I was also able to collect real-time data from a PLC and send it to my web application using industrial communication protocols.</p>

    <p>Lastly, when it comes to office tools, I am proficient with Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, which I use regularly to write reports for my projects and prepare presentations for oral exams.</p>

    <p>Even though I’ve developed a wide range of skills over the years, I know there’s still a lot more to learn, especially when it comes to new languages, technologies, and services. I remain highly motivated to continue learning and growing in this field.</p>
