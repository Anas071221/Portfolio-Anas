    <h1>Training and Work Experience</h1>

    <h2>Training at HELHa</h2>
    <p>During my studies at HELHa, I had to attend training sessions at the Technocampus in Mons every year.</p>

    <p>In my first year, the training introduced us to the basics of pneumatics, hydraulics, and industrial electrical systems.</p>

    <p>In the second year, I deepened my understanding of sensors, instrumentation, and control systems. I learned to use different types of sensors and to create small programs on Schneider PLCs, for example, to control a motor.</p>

    <p>Finally, in the third year, I completed a major group project. The goal was to remotely collect data from a PLC (the “SIF401” model) using the OPC-UA protocol, and then transmit this data in real time via the WebSocket protocol to a web application displaying key parameters such as the voltage inside the PLC. In addition, we used an XR headset to visualize the same data.</p>

    <p>All of these training sessions were valuable and full of learning experiences. They allowed me to step outside the classroom and spend a few days in a professional environment at Technocampus.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>Alongside my studies, I also had the opportunity to work as a student IT assistant at Intermarché.</p>

    <p>My role involved replacing all of the store’s IT equipment, including computers, monitors, mice, and Zebra TC52 terminals. I was also responsible for installing the applications requested by the manager, updating the devices, checking the network cables in the server cabinet, and connecting the new weighing scales to the store’s internal network.</p>

    <p>This student job allowed me to engage with professional IT technicians and gain my first hands-on experience in a role directly related to my field of study.</p>
