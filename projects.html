    <h1>My Projects</h1>

    <p>Throughout my studies in Industrial Computing, I had the opportunity to take part in several multidisciplinary projects that involved project management, electronics, programming, web development, database management, and oral presentations.</p>

    <h2>My First Project</h2>
    <p>My first project, carried out during my first year, consisted of creating a dice game using the C language. In this game, two players competed by rolling two dice each turn. The dice values were randomly generated between 1 and 6, and the first player to reach a total of 55 points won the game. The program was connected to a Velleman K8055 communication board, which lit up several red LEDs corresponding to the values generated.</p>
    <p>For the electronics part, I built the circuit using CMOS components, all wired on the same board as the LEDs. I then created the PCB layout based on a schematic designed in ARES, using the Proteus application.</p>

    <h2>My Second Project</h2>
    <p>In my second year, I worked on a more ambitious project, which I had to complete within five days. The objective was to sort balls by color. I started by designing a physical structure using MakerBeam profiles to build a multi-level slide system. On the software side, I developed a web application using JavaScript with the Express.js framework, Twig for rendering the pages, and Prisma ORM to connect the database to the server.</p>
    <p>For the electronics, I programmed an Arduino UNO to manage all the components, including a stepper motor to direct the balls into the correct containers, two servo motors to control the drops at each level, and a HUSKYLENS smart camera capable of detecting the color of each ball and sending an ID based on the detected color.</p>

    <h2>My Third Project</h2>
    <p>Finally, in my third year, I had the opportunity to propose my own project idea. I decided to develop an autonomous sliding door system. The concept was simple: the door could be opened either using an authorized RFID tag or by entering a code on a 4x4 membrane keypad.</p>
    <p>To implement this project, I used an ESP8266 microcontroller to manage the entire electronic system and send data in real time to my mobile application.</p>
    <p>On the software side, I developed a mobile application using React Native (with Expo Go), which allowed me to monitor the door’s status remotely. The app included three pages: a home page, a dashboard displaying the most recent access, and a history page listing all past accesses, along with a real-time graph.</p>

    <p>Through these projects, I acquired new skills and programming languages, but most importantly, I learned how to manage my time effectively and spread out the work throughout a project. This time management ability is significant to me because I didn’t possess it at the beginning of my degree. Today, I can confidently say that I’ve developed it.</p>
